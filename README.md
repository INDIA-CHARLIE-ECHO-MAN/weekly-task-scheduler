# weekly-task-scheduler
###
This python project is to make an application that allows the user to create tasks for themselves and assign them to the days of the week.
When they have finished the tasks, they can close the task and the task will appear in a list of closed tasks of that day. 
They can delete the tasks they have made, or organise all the tasks from an open tasks panel.
